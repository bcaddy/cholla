/*!
 * \brief Computes the left and right interface states using PPM with limiting in the characteristic variables. This
 * uses the PPM method described in Felker & Stone 2018 "A fourth-order accurate finite volume method for ideal MHD via
 * upwind constrained transport". This method computes the 3rd order interface then applies a mixture of monoticity
 * constraints from from Colella & Sekora 2008, McCorquodale & Colella 2011, and Colella et al. 2011. We found that this
 * newer method and limiters was more stable, less oscillatory, and faster than the method described in Stone et al.
 * 2008 which was previously used. The difference is most pronounced in the Brio & Wu shock tube where the PPM
 * oscillations are much smaller using this method.
 *
 * \tparam dir The direction to reconstruct. 0=X, 1=Y, 2=Z
 * \param[in] dev_conserved The conserved variable array
 * \param[out] dev_bounds_L The array of left interfaces
 * \param[out] dev_bounds_R The array of right interfaces
 * \param[in] nx The number of cells in the X-direction
 * \param[in] ny The number of cells in the Y-direction
 * \param[in] nz The number of cells in the Z-direction
 * \param[in] gamma The adiabatic index
